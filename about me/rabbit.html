<h2>IM RABBIT</h2>
Rabbits are small, herbivorous mammals known for their soft fur, long ears, and powerful hind legs. They are social and active creatures, often found in the wild as well as kept as pets. Wild rabbits typically live in burrows and are skilled at digging and hopping to escape predators.</p>

Rabbits are herbivores, feeding on grass, vegetables, and plants. Their strong teeth grow continuously, so they need to chew regularly to keep them at the right length. They are also crepuscular, meaning they are most active during the early morning and evening hours.</p>

Domesticated rabbits are gentle and friendly, making them popular pets. They require proper care, including a balanced diet, a clean living space, and regular exercise. Rabbits are also known for their playful and curious nature, often forming bonds with their human companions.</p>

In some cultures, rabbits are symbols of luck, fertility, and renewal, celebrated for their charm and adorable demeanor.</p>
